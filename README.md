# arc-boosts
My custom boosts for Arc Browser

To add these, copy the ```style.css``` file into a new style-boost on arc. They should work automatically once this is done and enabled.

## Current Boosts:
- Overleaf customisation: customises the accent (green) colour of overleaf to be
the accent colour the arc space. It also changes the background colours to black (amoled)
- EdStem customisation: customises the accent (purple) colour of edstem to be the accent colour of the arc space. It also changes the background colours to black (amoled)
- Discord customisation: customises interactive buttons to be the primary colour of the arc space. Background is black (amoled)

## Future Boosts:
- [ ] Blackboard style boost (WIP)
- [ ] echo360 style boost (with volume booster)
